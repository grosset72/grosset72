## 🔍 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **applied mathematics, economics, and management science**, with a focus on:

- Optimal control and dynamic optimization  
- Differential games and Stackelberg games  
- Mean-field games and stochastic control  
- Mathematical models in economics, finance, and marketing  
- Applications to sustainability, advertising, vaccination campaigns, and industrial organization  

I combine **theoretical modeling** with **applications to real-world economic and social systems**.
